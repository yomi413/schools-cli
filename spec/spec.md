# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application 
	My CLI class is where my prompts are located.  It's what makes my program interactive.

- [x] Pull data from an external source 
	I had to pull data from 2 pages on a website: 
		(a) page 1 = https://insideschools.org/search/results?borough=bronx&district=8&neighborhood=&grade_level=ms&button=" (page 1 holds items 1-20)
		(b) page_2 = https://insideschools.org/search/results/page/2?borough=bronx&button=&district=8&grade_level=ms&neighborhood=" (page 2 holds items 21 and 22)

- [x] Implement both list and detail views
	The list is generated from the pages mentioned above while the majority of the school details had to be gathered from each school's link.
